Avoid errors when using WordPress MultiSite network activation

== Description ==

When running WordPress MultiSite, you have a very handy feature called network activation. It allows you to activate a plugin for the entire network of sites. The trouble is that it only does half the job.

Some plugins have an install procedure that is meant to be run only on activation. However, when you do a network activation, that install procedure is only run for the current site. So, you end up with plugins not working properly on all the other sites.

What this plugin does:

* when doing a network de/activation, it triggers the de/activation hook on all sites in the network
* when creating a new site, it triggers the activation hook for all active network plugins on that site

Make sure your host is running PHP 5. The only foolproof way to do this is to add this line to wp-config.php (after the opening `<?php` tag):

`var_dump(PHP_VERSION);`
